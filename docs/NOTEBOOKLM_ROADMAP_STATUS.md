# NotebookLM Annex Status (F39–F80)

Living status doc. **Read this first each session.** Spec: `docs/NOTEBOOKLM_ROADMAP.md`.
Composes on the completed Drive roadmap (`docs/DRIVE_ROADMAP.md`, F1–F38 shipped+live).

## Phase status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| N0 | Recon + core rails (E1/E2/E3) | **recon confirmed; build in progress (this PR)** |
| N1 | Broadcast surface | **build in progress (this PR)** — shapes+CLI+rituals+2 gap-repairs |
| N2 | Probe & verification | todo |
| N3 | Judgment/relationship/self-knowledge | todo |
| N4 | Lineage & society | todo |
| N5 | The Organ (optional autonomous) | todo (gated; not entered) |

## N0 recon — confirmed 2026-07-17

All F1–F38 modules present + test-hardened. `notebooklm/`, `returns`, `embassy` are net-new.
Load-bearing reuse points verified with signatures (see recon in git history). Three named
unknowns resolved: `modelGeneration` ABSENT (add), local transcription EXISTS
(`voice/whisper-local.ts`), planner consult hook NOT LIVE.

## Gap register (gap-repair protocol)

Structural gaps (minimal Drive-side repair PR first, then annex builds — D-N0.3):

| Gap | What | Blocks | Repair plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G-PLANNER** | `matchDeadEnds` wired only in `dream.ts`, not the agent `GoalPlanner` (no live plan pre-commit hook). Seam: post-`GoalPlanner.plan()` `goal-planner.ts:490`. | F69/F70/F73 (N3) | Drive-side repair PR wires dead-ends pre-check into the planner; annex adds precedent/assumption consults alongside. |
| **G-F32WIRE** | F32 second-opinion complete but no trigger site; nothing constructs a `DecisionPacket`. `cognition/epistemic-gate.ts` owns `ImpactLevel`. | F48/F65 (N3/N4) | Repair PR adds the above-threshold trigger site + `awaitDissent` block. |
| ~~G-F13~~ | Weekly self-diff — **REPAIRED** (src/core/gdrive/self-diff.ts, weekly cron, F53 topology slot). | ~~F42/F53~~ | DONE — Drive-side repair PR shipped. |
| **G-JUDGE** | No `judgeRoute`; existing `skill-eval` judge is same-route position-swap (violates independence). | E4/F64/F68 (N2+) | Add `sudo/judge` alias + config pin; hold-for-human where no independent route. |

Additive gaps (small, mechanical, done inside their phase):

| Gap | What | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| G-MODELGEN | add `modelGeneration` to `ResolvedRoute` + `aliases.ts` | N4 (F64) |
| ~~G-F46MARK~~ | **DONE** — comments.ts extracts `[F46]`/`F46:` marker → dataset row + memory name | N1 (F46) |
| G-CANARYWRITE | `registerCanary(entry)` writer (canary is read/trip only) | N4 (F67) |
| ~~G-F52RANK~~ | **DONE** — dream.ts ranks (orphaned>stale>hold); open-questions file carries `ranked[]` | N1 (F52) |
| G-PROPOSALS | `tasks/proposals/` folder key (blackboard peer-read grabs all `.json`) | N4 (F70) |
| G-F43 | incident-theater net-new (consumes `ops/incidents` + `unpackBundle`) | N1 (F43) |

## Decisions

- **D-N0.1** Materialized `docs/DRIVE_ROADMAP.md` from session text + STATUS ledger (spec file was absent) rather than block.
- **D-N0.2** Provenance stays JSON-in-`content` + belief graph; no new `StructuredMemory` column (no schema fork).
- **D-N0.3** Four structural gaps get minimal Drive-side repair PRs at the phase that needs them, then annex builds on them.
- **D-N0.4** `NlmClient`/programmatic NotebookLM access stays out of N0–N4 entirely (export-lane + rituals + returns only).
- **D-N0.5** notebooklm folders live under `sudo-ai/notebooklm/` via a self-contained `ensureNotebookLmTree` reusing `DriveClient` primitives — NOT appended to gdrive `CANONICAL_FOLDERS` (keeps the base tree clean when notebooklm is disabled).
- **D-N0.6** Master switch `SUDO_NOTEBOOKLM=1`, default OFF (mirrors `SUDO_GDRIVE`); requires `SUDO_GDRIVE=1`.

## Safety-critical acceptance fixtures (for spot-check)

| Fixture | File | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| Zone screen sweep | `tests/notebooklm/zone-screen.test.ts` | seeded zone-1 record absent from every compiled shape; secrets regex catches |
| Returns routing | `tests/notebooklm/returns.test.ts` | filename convention → tier/category; unparseable held; quarantine-before-route |
| (later) judge independence | tbd (N2) | student ≠ judge enforced |
| (later) embassy verbatim | tbd (N4) | verbatim-dump held, authored distillate external |

## Annex B — API-day upgrade map (maintain from day one)

| Ritual | Becomes |
|---|---|
| add/refresh sources | `sources.sync(shapeRegistry)` nightly |
| generate Audio/Video | `studio.generate` on cadence; audio → returns → F59 |
| chat probe answers | `notebook.query(probeSet)` → E4 |
| flashcard/quiz | `studio.flashcards(corpus)` |
| Deep Research | `research.run(target)` → returns |
| paste-backs | eliminated; E2 consumes API payloads, same provenance rules |
